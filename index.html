  <h1>Background Concepts (Typing Mode)</h1>

  <h2>1. Full Page Background</h2>
  <p>
    This applies the background image to the entire web page.  
    The image covers the whole screen, stays centered, and does not repeat.  
    Used when you want a single large image behind the entire website.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Hero Section With Overlay</h2>
  <p>
    A hero section is the big banner at the top of the page.  
    It has a background image and a dark transparent overlay on top  
    so that text becomes clearly readable.  
    Mostly used for welcome headings.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Contain vs Cover</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Cover:</strong>  
    Fills the entire area, image may crop, looks clean and edge-to-edge.  
    Best for banners or large backgrounds.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Contain:</strong>  
    Shows the whole image without cropping, but empty space may appear.  
    Best when you need the full image visible.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Repeat Background</h2>
  <p>
    A small image or pattern repeats like tiles to fill the element.  
    Used for textures, designs, wallpapers, and decorative backgrounds.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Multiple Backgrounds</h2>
  <p>
    You can apply more than one background image at the same time.  
    Example: gradient on top + image at the back.  
    Useful for adding highlights, overlays, lighting effects, or shapes.
